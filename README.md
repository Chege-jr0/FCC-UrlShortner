# FCC-UrlShortner
 A simple website that is used to get the Url of website and create a short url.
 I had to use the json file to display the results and the console window.
 I setted the firts url to a short url of 1
 After that every url, I added 1 as an interger to create another short url.
 I used the MongoDb for the database.
